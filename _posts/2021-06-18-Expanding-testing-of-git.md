# Expanding testing of Git

I'm really digging into using Git for versioning for work and personal projects including posting blogs using this as my main platform. As I've started going down the rabbit hole of using Linux and the command line more, it's become more important to have a generally available and reliable method to manage scripts and files. I'm also looking at expanding deployments and delivery of information and automation using Git which ties into exploring this set of products. While things like Wordpress are much more user focsed for deploying websites due to the extremely reliable and extensible software, something like this for a personal site is really much simpler and effective for quickly publishing out information from any platform, including straight from the command line.
